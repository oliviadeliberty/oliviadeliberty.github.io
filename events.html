      <p>We are still working out when our first meeting will be but by taking the survey, I can get a better idea of when it can be. Currently, the thought is that Tuesday or Wednesday would be ideal especially because you might get sick of us if you spent the weekend with us then had to see us the next day or vice versa (<a href="about.html">what do I mean by that?</a>). What we do during this meetings will mostly be discussing ideas and <b>PROGRAMING!!!</b>. Also, we will talk about strategy as well as discuss how we will operate withing teams. </p>
