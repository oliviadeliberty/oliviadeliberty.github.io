      <h2>What exactly does our club do?</h2>
      <p>Hackathon club is a club that competes in the <a href="https://mlh.io"?>Major League Hacking(MLH)</a> as well as other competitions. Within our club, we will be seperated into dynamic and cooperative teams. Our club is focused on cooperation and effectiveness in group settings and with teams. It is a great way to meet a diverse group of individuals who love to create. <u>You do not need any experience in coding!</u> These competitions are not just about coding but also entrepeneurship and presentation. Also, we will help you learn more about coding. Coding, innovation, and presentation skills are great skills that will carry you far in life even if you don't go into a computer job.</p>
